### Alex Merced's Angular 8 Front-End

this is another front-end project where I am taking the headless blog I created with contentful.com and creating a variety of front-ends for it using different technologies. To complete this I had to use Angular 8 loops, lifecycle methods, components, props and data. I used fetch to grab data from the API store it into the app components data then send the individual records as props down to the card component.
